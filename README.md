## Abandonment of Instabot

## Common "Errors"
### ds_user
This is caused from cookies interferring with the execution of the program. This is solved by deleting the "config" folder every time the program is run

### ERROR - Error unknown send request
Honestly, this isn't really an error, as the program still runs in spite of this

### Waiting 2.63 min. due to too many requests.
Program may stop a few times due to too many requests

### Detecting unusual activity (HACKED_LOCK)
Excessive amounts of requests may cause your account to go into some sort of "lockdown"? All I had to do was get a security code and confirm it's me.
